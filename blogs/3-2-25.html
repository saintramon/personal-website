    <h3>First author in a paper</h3>
    <p>Being a first author at a research paper is a big deal, it shows how much time and effort you dedicated in bringing that paper to its full form.</p>
    <p>Being the first surname in a paper tells the readers this is your idea, your concept, your intellectual thinking.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today I found out that this is really not the case, at least in the university I'm attending.</p>
    <p>I don't have a problem per se, it's just that this is absolute and the contribution of work is not really taken into consideration.</p>    
    <p>We also have to consider that they indeed deserve to be the first author if the idea came from them, if not, then several factors should be considered.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If an individual can be designated as a first author, without the guarantee that they will be at their 100% when working on the paper, then it is problematic.</p>
    <p>This is not a rant, but a thinking on the current system, which should be changed.</p>
