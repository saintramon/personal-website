    <h3>Why Research should be your favorite subject</h3>
    <p>Some people, when asked about their favorite subject, the typical replies are Science, Computer Programming 1, Discrete Math, and others</p>
    <p>These are great answers and contribute to the advancement of society. But ask them about research, majority of them loathes that subject</p>
    <br>
    <p>Research can be really taxing on people (Maybe create a study about the attitude of lay people on research?) as it requires full mental, physical, and spiritual strength of an individual</p>
    <p>But we should realize that research is hard because it makes life easy for future generations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Research is advancing the current knowledge and capabilities of the humans. It forwards the different fields.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now if you ask me what is my favorite subject/course? I will say Research. I've had those reactions, yes.</p>
    <p>But I really find research fascinating, a scientific process, so simple yet so complex, can be fit into a diagram but should be accomplished in huge amount of hours.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But then ask yourself the question again, why is research not your favorite subject?</p>
