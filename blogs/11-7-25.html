    <h3>Why everyone should be bored</h3>    
    <p>In this time where we can get dopamine hits from a small electronic device, maybe it's time to refocus where we spend our time on</p>
    <p>Am I too preachy? No. Because I was also stuck in the same limbo as you are.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Everything seems so fast right now, everything can be accessed through your phone. Which is great! Because our mobile devices are really developed to be an all-in-one avenue for all of our concerns.</p>
    <p>But having such a powerful device requires the user to have responsibility also. Owning a smartphone is very addicting and very distracting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Waiting in line? Let me pull out my tiktok. Walking? Let me scroll through my Facebook feed while I do it. Bored at lunch? A quick look on Instagram stories.</p>
    <p>No one wants to be bored anymore. No one wants to be sitting at a park without doing anything. No one wants to walk to their destination without glancing here and there on their phones.</p>
    <p>Everyone is addicted. Everything is stimulating.</p>
    <p>Is it a skill issue? Is it something you can really control?</p>
    <br>
    <p>The answer is both. Yes you can have the will power and choice to avoid your phones.</p>
    <p>But no because the applications and the devices are really designed to lure people in.</p>
    <p>Take a look at tiktok with their "scrolling" feature, it is designed to be like SLOT MACHINES! It is designed to be very addicting.</p>
    <p>Look at how you refresh your facebook and instagram feeds. Scrolling up! Just like casino slot machines!</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is now time to reflect on yourself. Why do you use your smartphone for? What are your intentions with it?</p>
    <p>The simple scrolling and watching shorts takes a lot of your time.</p>
    <p>And it strays you away from building real connection with real people.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Be mindful, always.</p>
