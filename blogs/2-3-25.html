    <h3>Run for Hope</h3>
    <p>Today, I just finished my first official "race". Clocking in at 25 minutes for 4.5km.</p>
    <p>I can't believe that I will be pursuing the hobby of running, as I'm a slow person and loathes anything that involves cardio. But during the holidays last year, I was able to pick up the pace and start the hobby.</p>
    <p>I achieved my first 5k sub 30 in just 2 weeks, and very near in breaking the 10k sub 1 barrier. The progress is fast, I assume the plateau will come soon.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Today, I ran a 5k sub 30 again. Not for myself, but for the kids that are abandoned. Run for Hope is a charity run which aims to help the kids that are neglected and abused.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What a great way to start my birth month.</p>
